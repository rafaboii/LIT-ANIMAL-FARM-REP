      'Cynical and pessimistic',
      'Intelligent and literate',
      'Emotionally detached',
      'Outlives most other animals'
    ],
    analysis: `Benjamin represents the cynical intellectuals who see through political propaganda but do nothing to challenge it. His statement that "life would go on as it had always gone onâ€”that is, badly" reflects his fatalistic worldview.`
  },
  squealer: {

    image: 'https://hebbkx1anhila5yf.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/Animal%20Farm%20Project.png-AXQCA8BfUwfiypQu0WDuszux4yvANd.jpeg',

      'Vain and materialistic',
      'Lazy and self-centered',
      'Yearns for human comforts',
      'Disloyal to the revolution'
    ],
    analysis: `Mollie represents the bourgeoisie or middle class who are unwilling to sacrifice their luxuries for revolutionary ideals. Her departure symbolizes those who fled Russia after the revolution rather than live under communism.`
