              <p>One of the central themes in Animal Farm is how power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. The pigs, especially Napoleon, gradually assume more power and privilege, eventually betraying the very principles of the revolution they led.</p>
              <p>Orwell demonstrates how the ideals of equality and shared prosperity are subverted when leaders prioritize their own interests over the common good. The progression from "All animals are equal" to "All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others" encapsulates this corruption.</p>

              <p>Orwell explores how language can be weaponized to control populations. Squealer, Napoleon's propagandist, uses rhetorical techniques to confuse, intimidate, and manipulate the other animals, demonstrating how those in power can use language to maintain control.</p>
              <p>The constant revision of history, particularly regarding Snowball's role in the revolution and the Battle of the Cowshed, shows how controlling the narrative of the past helps secure power in the present.</p>

              <p>Animal Farm examines how revolutionary ideals can be corrupted. The initial revolution is driven by Old Major's vision of equality and freedom, but these noble goals are gradually abandoned as the new leaders become corrupted by power.</p>
              <p>The novel suggests that revolutions often fail not because their ideals are flawed, but because those who gain power in the aftermath betray those ideals for personal gain.</p>

              <p>Despite the revolution's promise to eliminate class distinctions, Animal Farm quickly develops a new class system with the pigs as the privileged elite. This reflects Orwell's critique of how revolutionary movements often reproduce the very inequalities they sought to abolish.</p>
              <p>The stratification of animal society—with pigs at the top, followed by dogs as enforcers, and the other animals as workers—mirrors class divisions in human society.</p>
