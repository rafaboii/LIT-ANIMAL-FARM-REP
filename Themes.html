                <p>One of the central themes in Animal Farm is how power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. The pigs, especially Napoleon, gradually assume more power and privilege, eventually betraying the very principles of the revolution they led.</p>
                <p>Orwell demonstrates how the ideals of equality and shared prosperity are subverted when leaders prioritize their own interests over the common good. The progression from "All animals are equal" to "All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others" encapsulates this corruption.</p>

                <p>Animal Farm examines how revolutionary ideals can be corrupted. The initial revolution is driven by Old Major's vision of equality and freedom, but these noble goals are gradually abandoned as the new leaders become corrupted by power.</p>
                <p>The novel suggests that revolutions often fail not because their ideals are flawed, but because those who gain power in the aftermath betray those ideals for personal gain.</p>

                <p>The stratification of animal society—with pigs at the top, followed by dogs as enforcers, and the other animals as workers—mirrors class divisions in human society.</p>
