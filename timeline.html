              <h3>Old Major's Speech</h3>
              <p>Old Major, an elderly prize boar, calls a meeting of all animals and shares his vision of a future rebellion against human tyranny. He teaches them the revolutionary song "Beasts of England" and dies three days later.</p>

              <p>After Mr. Jones neglects to feed the animals, they break into the store-shed. When Jones and his men try to restore order, the animals drive them off the farm. The animals rename Manor Farm as "Animal Farm" and establish the Seven Commandments of Animalism.</p>

              <h3>Early Days of Animal Farm</h3>
              <p>The animals work hard to harvest the crops. The pigs, who are the most intelligent animals, become the supervisors. Snowball organizes Animal Committees for education, while Napoleon takes nine puppies away for "education." The mystery of the disappearing milk is solvedâ€”the pigs are mixing it into their mash.</p>

              <h3>Battle of the Cowshed</h3>
              <p>News of the rebellion spreads to other farms. In October, Jones and his men attempt to recapture the farm. Snowball leads the animals in a successful defense, later named the "Battle of the Cowshed." Snowball and Boxer are awarded medals for their bravery.</p>

              <h3>Snowball's Expulsion</h3>
              <p>Mollie, who misses her ribbons and sugar, leaves the farm. Snowball and Napoleon increasingly disagree, particularly over the windmill project. During a meeting to vote on the windmill, Napoleon unleashes his trained dogs, who chase Snowball off the farm. Napoleon then abolishes the Sunday Meetings and announces that decisions will be made by a committee of pigs.</p>

              <h3>Building the Windmill</h3>
              <p>Napoleon announces that they will build the windmill after all, claiming it was his idea all along. The animals work hard on the windmill while also maintaining the farm. Napoleon begins trading with neighboring farms and moves into the farmhouse with the other pigs. The Fourth Commandment is altered to "No animal shall sleep in a bed with sheets."</p>

              <h3>Windmill Destruction and Purges</h3>
              <p>A storm destroys the windmill. Napoleon blames Snowball and sentences him to death. The animals begin rebuilding the windmill with thicker walls. Food shortages occur, and Napoleon uses Whymper to spread false information about Animal Farm's prosperity. When hens rebel against an order to surrender their eggs, Napoleon cuts off their food until they submit. Many animals "confess" to being in league with Snowball and are executed. "Beasts of England" is replaced with a new song praising Napoleon.</p>
              <div class="timeline-quote">"Surely, comrades, you do not want Jones back?"</div>

              <h3>Battle of the Windmill</h3>
              <p>The Sixth Commandment is altered to "No animal shall kill any other animal without cause." Napoleon sells timber to Frederick, who pays with forged banknotes. Frederick and his men attack the farm and blow up the rebuilt windmill. The animals drive them off in a battle later called the "Battle of the Windmill." The pigs discover a case of whisky and get drunk. The Fifth Commandment is changed to "No animal shall drink alcohol to excess."</p>
              <div class="timeline-quote">"Comrades, here is my toast: To the prosperity of The Manor Farm!"</div>

              <h3>Boxer's Fate</h3>
              <p>Rations are reduced again, except for the pigs and dogs. Squealer constantly reports increased food production. The pigs receive privileges like alcohol and education for their young. Moses returns with his tales of Sugarcandy Mountain. Boxer collapses while working on the windmill. Napoleon promises to send him to a veterinary hospital, but instead sells him to a knacker. Squealer convinces the animals that Boxer died in the hospital, and the pigs use the money to buy more whisky.</p>
              <div class="timeline-quote">"It is my lung. It does not matter. I think you will be able to finish the windmill without me."</div>
            </div>

              <h3>Full Circle</h3>
              <p>Years pass. The farm is more prosperous but only the pigs and dogs benefit. The windmill is used for milling corn rather than generating electricity. The pigs begin walking on two legs, and the sheep are taught to bleat "Four legs good, two legs better!" The Seven Commandments are replaced with a single maxim: "All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others." The pigs entertain human farmers, and Napoleon announces that the farm's name is changed back to "Manor Farm." The other animals observe the pigs and humans playing cards and quarreling, and can no longer tell the difference between them.</p>
              <div class="timeline-quote">"The creatures outside looked from pig to man, and from man to pig, and from pig to man again; but already it was impossible to say which was which."</div>
